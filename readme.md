To tackle this problem, we're going to use dynamic programming. This method will help us figure out all the possible ways we can attend your classes over a period of (N) days without missing four or more days in a row. Once we have that information, we can easily work out the chances of you missing your graduation ceremony.

Imagine a grid where each cell, let's call it (dp[i][j]), represents the number of ways you can attend (or not attend) classes up to day (i), ending with (j) consecutive days of absence. The point here is that (j) can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3 because missing four or more consecutive days is a no-go.

Let's start simple:
- On day zero (before the term even starts), you're obviously not absent, so (dp[0][0] = 1). It's our starting point.
- And since you can't start the term by being absent, (dp[0][1]), (dp[0][2]), and (dp[0][3]) are all 0. You haven't even had a chance to miss a class yet.

Now, for the rules of the game:
- If we attend class on day (i), it doesn't matter what happened before. we can add up all the ways we got to day (i-1) because today's a fresh start. So, (dp[i][0]) equals the sum of all the ways to get to (dp[i-1][j]) for (j) from 0 to 3.
- If you're absent on day (i), then it's like building a streak. An absence today ((j)) adds to yesterday's absence ((j-1)), for (j) being 1 to 3.

To find out how many ways we can navigate through (N) days without breaking the attendance rule, we sum up all the paths that lead to day (N), which includes all combinations of attending and being absent up to three days in a row.

Now, the main part: calculating the chance of missing our graduation.We look at all the ways we could have made it through the (N) days and subtract the ways that would lead us to miss the last day. This difference gives us the number of scenarios where we miss our graduation. We present this as a fraction of the total number of ways to navigate the (N) days, giving us the probability of missing the ceremony in a neat "missed/total" format.
